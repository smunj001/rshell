#RSHELL (Terminal)

Overview
--------
The program RSHELL is an open ended project which is a reproduction of a command shell or a temrinal. It will print a command prompt (i.e $) and read in a commands on a single line. One will be able to execute common commands like (ls, cd, echo, mkdir, etc...) along with flags. The commands will have the form: cmd = executable[argumentList][connector cmd] and can be separated by three connectors ( &&, ||, ;). 


Execution
------
$ git clone https://github.com/smunj001/rshell.git
$ cd rshell
$ git checkout hw2
$ make
$ bin/rshell


Notes
-----------
*HW 2 is the foundation of the terminal where the user will be able to enter basic commands such as: echo Hello and RSHELL will react according to the command.
