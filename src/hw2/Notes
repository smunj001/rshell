The difference between “::” “.” and “->”

1)  -> for accessing object member variables and methods via pointer to object

    Foo *foo = new Foo();
    foo->member_var = 10;
    foo->member_func();

2)  . for accessing object member variables and methods via object instance

    Foo foo;
    foo.member_var = 10;
    foo.member_func();

3)  :: for accessing static variables and methods of a class/struct or namespace. 
    It can also be used to access variables and functions from another scope 
    (actually class, struct, namespace are scopes in that case)

    int some_val = Foo::static_var;
    Foo::static_method();
    int max_int = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    
    ----------
    
     echo hello
     
     temp[0] = echo
     temp[1] = hello
     
     
     temp stores commnad
     arg stores argument (ie akldfjaklsdfjklasdfjalksdf)
     
     
      int procID, status;
        
        procID = fork();
        
        if (procID == 0) {
            int t = execvp(args[0], args);
            exit(t);
        }
        wait(&status);
